Kristina's Awsome Quiz!

This is a very simple quiz because I just wanted to get the basics of how to build it down. After a couple of weeks, I finally have an inuitve, functioning quiz.

It starts off with a big title, large start button, and the rules.

When you hit start, the start button becomes hidden and other elements show up under the start game function which inclues the question, timer, and answers.

Instead of hitting a 'next' button, you simply click on one of the answers and then you will be directed to the next question. There is a score being tracked at the top.



Once you are done, you are directed to a page where you enter in your initails. these intials become pasted on the page to show the highest scores. This is done through a tool in the browser than can save small amounts of data.
